7.a Create three ArrayLists that can hold the following types and assign it at least 3 different values to each of them:

Integer
String
Boolean
Hint
7.b Write a function that takes an ArrayList of Strings as parameter and prints each String.

7.c Write a function that receives an ArrayList of Integers as a parameter and returns the sum of all elements in the array.

7.d Write a function that receives an ArrayList of Integers as a parameter and returns the average value.

7.e (optional) Consider how you could write a function that takes an array (not an ArrayList) of integers as a parameter and returns a new array of the ints sorted from lowest to highest value.
